                <h2>Who I am</h2>
                <p>
                    I'm a fourth-year undergraduate at the University of Alberta in the Computing Science Specialization program, expecting to graduate in the Fall of 2021. I grew up in Edmonton, Alberta, graduating from W.P Wagner high school in 2017. 
                    I like to stay active year-round, enjoying bike rides in the river valley, skating in the winter, and playing Squash. I've been interested in computers and technology as long as I can remember, and look forward to starting full time
                    work as a programmer after completing my degree. 
                </p>

                <h2>Skills to offer</h2>
                <p>
                    My strongest programming languages are Python, including Numpy, Scipy, and PyTorch, as well as C and C++. Other languages that I have some experience with include Java/Kotlin, Javascript/HTML/CSS, MATLAB, C#/Unity C#, VBA, SQL/XQuery/SPARQL, and CUDA.
                    I wouldn't say that I'm fluent in these languages, but I became familiar with how they work and it would take minimal effort to pick them up again. Most of my programming work as a Research Assistant involved scientific computing, and as a result 
                    is the area of computing science I have the most experience with. I am also interested in performance optimization and parallel computing. Workflow tools I am familiar with include Git/Github, VSCode/Visual Studio, and Unix/Bash, and Unity.

                        <p>There are 10 kinds of people in the world: those who can extrapolate from incomplete information, and those who werenâ€™t expecting this to be a joke about ternary. </p>

                            A Buddhist walks into a pizza place and says "Make me one with everything." The cook makes the pizza and the total comes to 13.95. The Buddhist hands over a 20, and the cook puts it in the register and goes back to making pizzas.
                            The Buddhist asks for his change, and the cook says "Change must come from within." Someone else walks in and asks the Buddhist "Are you gonna leave?" and the Buddhist says "Namaste."
